This is a leightwieght protocol generator inspired by protoGen by Piotr Tabor.
Its input is an xml file which should validate against the same XSD as for the
original protoGen.

The main goal is to be as much simplistic as possible and deliver a possibility
to generate repeatable pieces of code in the protocol implementation for LoXiM.
The only output is C++.

This generator makes assumptions on the rest of LoXiM code and this is on
purpose. It's more integrated with the rest of the project that way.

It doesn't have the ambition to be protable, reusable or even error-proof. For
more advanced use cases use protoGen or Google Protocol Buffers.

Type make to compile it (you should have Xerces-C 3.0).

To regenerate the protocol, run 
/bin/sh run.sh
