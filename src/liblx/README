liblx is the LoXiM client API for the C language.

--- perhaps some documentation here ---


the provided Makefile is very temporary

this package should be integrated with autotools

requirements:
- making the whole distribution should also enter this directory
- if --enable-static, the static library liblx.a should be made
- if --enable-dynamic, the dynamic library liblx.so should be made
- make install should install liblx.h do $includedir and libs to $libdir
- make test should also run test.c
  (test.c needs to be cleaned up, queries which use store should be removed)
