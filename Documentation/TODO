It would be nice to do these things in LoXiM:

BUGS:
-refer to bug tracker

MODULARITY/AESTHETICS:
-abstract from the current executor

PERFORMANCE:
-modify FileDataStream (Protocol) to do some buffering
-remove memory leaks
-remove not necessary memory allocations
-improve statistics module (now nobody uses it but it allocates a lot of data)

BUILD CHAIN:
-let autotools be used to build lw_protogen, but only optionally, when Xerces-3
 is available
-tests (in indexes there are some and they don't compile (they're close))

ADMINISTRATION:
-there is a big mess in documentation, should be tidied up
-start making backups
-automatic builds and reports

TESTS:
-chceking: memory leaks, heap allocation, concurrency problems
-white box testing
-black box testing
-make testing framework in a way that problems could be easly tracked

DETAILS:
-let server and client print their versions (according to what is specified in
 configure.ac)
