<h2>JLoXiM</h2>
<p>
LoXiM is written in C++. There is an effort to implement similar ideas in Java, it's called JLoXiM. LoXiM an JLoXiM strongly cooperate with each other. There is a plan to be as much interoperable as possible. Currently, the protocol is the same, so it will be possible to use one client and switch the database almost seamlessly.
