<h2>Welcome to LoXiM - an experimental Database Management System</h2>
LoXiM is an object oriented, semistructured DBMS. It is intended to
serve a number of query languages. Currently only one is available,
namely the AOQL mentioned in
<a href="http://www.omg.org/docs/mars/07-09-13.pdf" target="_blank">the
whitepaper of OMG</a> 
known also as <a href="http://www.sbql.pl" target="_blank">SBQL</a> (Stack 
Based Query Language). We plan to serve soon also SQL, XQuery.
It is a research project - it's main purpose is to provide a stable platform for
testing, developing and inventing new ideas. We will also publish stable releases
suitable for production systems.
<p/>
Current state is alpha. For current release please refer to <a
href="download.html">documentation</a> section.
<p/>
We encourage you to test it, use it, report bugs, send us new ideas and contribute
in any way you want - there is plenty of work to do. Working on LoXiM means dealing
with cutting-edge approach to databases, brings much satisfaction and lets you explore
the unknown.
