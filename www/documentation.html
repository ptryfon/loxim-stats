<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>Downloading</h3>
Please refer to <a href="download.html">download section</a>
<h3>Packages</h3>
We've prepared several packages for you: RPM, deb and an ebuild. If you use a
system which doesn't support any of these, you may want to compile LoXiM
manually. For packages installation instructions refer to your operating
system's manual.
<h3>Compilation from source</h3>
LoXiM was tested on various Unix operating systems on various platforms. It
should compile anywhere, were g++ with tr1 (versions 4.0.0 and above) and
readline library is available .
<p/>
The process is standard:<br/>
If you got the sources directly from the repository, run (if you got a tarball, skip this step):
<pre>
$ ./bootstrap
</pre>
Having boostrapped or having downloaded a tarball, you may proceed to the following steps:
<pre>
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
</pre>
On NetBSD you should explictly point the additional libraries' directory:
<pre>
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib"
</pre>
<p/>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
LoXiM first looks for the configuration file in your home directory (~/.loxim.conf) and if it
fails, it looks for /etc/loxim.conf.<br/>
You should supply such a file. Probably, it will be a good start to copy the example from the
Documentation/ directory in the source tree.

<h3>Running</h3>
Provided, that you installed it properly and that binaries are on your PATH, just type:<br/>
<pre>
loxim_server
</pre><p/>
In order to connect to the server, type:<br/>
<pre>
lsbql
</pre>
login as root with random password and have fun :).<p/>

To shut the server down, type from the client console:
<pre>
#shutdown
</pre>
